# Get active Elementor widgets plugin for WordPress

### Purpose:
Less plugins you have on site, is better. But sometimes you couldn't say if the plugin is used on website or not.
This plugin (should) help to understand, which Elementor widgets are active and used on pages on the current website.
This plugin should be enabled only for checking, and disabled after that.
