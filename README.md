## Plugin is in development! You can use it on your sites on your own

# Used Elementor Widgets plugin for WordPress

### Purpose:
Less plugins you have on site, faster it's working(usually). But sometimes you couldn't say if the plugin is used on website or not.
This plugin (should) help to understand, which Elementor widgets are active and used on pages on the current website.
This plugin should be enabled only for checking, and disabled after that.


Keep in mind, that the plugins which contains elementor widgets could also have additional features adding some features to the Advanced section.
